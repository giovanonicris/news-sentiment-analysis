Part two, because you, our readers, had a lot to say.

Specifically, we asked you about what ""affordability"" means, how the economy is affecting you personally and how we, the media, could do a better job of informing you about it.

Judging from your responses, household budgets are definitely top of mind, as is inflation and tariffs.
