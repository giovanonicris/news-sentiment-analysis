BRUSSELS, Dec 30 (Reuters) - NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte warned on Monday that Russia is preparing for a major war, and said the alliance must be ready for it.

Rutte, speaking in Brussels, said NATO must build up its conventional forces and industrial base to match the challenge posed by Moscow, which he said was planning for a long-term confrontation with the West.

Rutte said NATO had made progress in strengthening its forces, but more was needed.

""We have to go further and faster,"" he said. ""We need to build up our conventional forces and our industrial base to match the challenge.""

He said NATO should aim to have 300,000 troops ready to deploy within 30 days, and a total of 500,000 within six months.

Rutte also called for increased defence spending by NATO members, saying the current target of 2% of GDP was not enough.

DUBAI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Yemen's more than decade-long civil war has flared up after a United Arab Emirates-backed separatist movement swept through territory in the south, splintering the Saudi-led coalition that was created to fight the Iran-aligned Houthi group.

Below are details of the key factions in the conflict in Yemen, which has caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises:

The tariffs, which Trump has said could be as high as 60% on Chinese goods and 10% to 20% on imports from other countries, would raise the cost of goods for U.S. consumers and businesses, and could lead to retaliation from trading partners.

""This could be the start of a global trade war,"" said one economist.

Trump has said the tariffs are needed to protect U.S. industries and bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States.

But economists say the tariffs would do more harm than good.
